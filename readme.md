## Clarification

**Problem 5** is implemented as an independent project in the crude repository, which has two branches: main and consensus-breaking-change. If you want to review the code for both branches, youâ€™ll need to download the repository and switch between them. However, the differences between the two branches are minimal, and the implementation details are explained in its [README](./src/problem5/crude/readme.md). You can refer to this file for clarification.
